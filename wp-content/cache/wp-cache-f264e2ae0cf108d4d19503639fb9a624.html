				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>AZTEC BATS COME ALIVE IN 10-4 WIN</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO, Calif. &#8211; After struggling to get the clutch hit in Friday&#8217;s series opener, San Diego State received contributions from throughout the lineup Saturday afternoon as it defeated Nevada, 10-4, at Tony Gwynn Stadium. Eight of nine starters recorded at least one hit while seven individuals had an RBI and scored a run.</p>
<p>In evening the three-game series at one apiece, the Aztecs improved to 10-4 overall and 3-2 in the Mountain West while the Wolf Pack fell to 6-8 (3-5 MW).</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t&#8217; start off too well for SDSU, however, as Nevada leadoff hitter Kyle Hunt hit the first pitch of the contest over the left field fence to give the visitors a quick lead. It got worse for the Aztecs when Trenton Brooks led off the second with a home run to right to give the Wolf Pack a 2-0 advantage.</p>
<p>While San Diego State had runners in scoring position in each of the first two frames, it wasn&#8217;t until the third that they cashed in. A leadoff single by Evan Potter was followed two outs later by an intentional walk to Ty France and a base on balls to Seby Zavala to load the bases. Freshman Andrew Brown then rocketed a double to left center that scored all three runners to give his team a 3-2 lead. Brown went on to finish the game with three hits, four RBI and a run scored in five at bats as SDSU led the remainder of the contest.</p>
<p>The Aztecs added a run in the fourth on an RBI single by Greg Allen that plated Steven Pallares, who had singled to open the inning and was sacrificed to second by Evan Potter. But Nevada made it a one-run contest again at 4-3 with a run in the top of the sixth, but that&#8217;s as close as they would get the rest of the way.</p>
<p>San Diego State countered the Wolf Pack run in that inning with three of its own in the bottom of the sixth. Those came on run-scoring singles by Ty France and Brown along with a sacrifice fly by Zavala. The Aztecs&#8217; final two runs (one in the seventh and two in the eighth) were scored courtesy of RBI singles by Tim Zier and Pallares along with a sac fly from Tyler Adkison.</p>
<p>SDSU starter Bubba Derby tossed the first five innings allowing two runs on six hits with a pair of walks and three strikeouts and would pick up the win to improve to 2-0. Michael Cederoth, who came on in the top of the eighth, surrendered just a walk in the ninth en route to recording his fifth save of the season.</p>
<p>In addition to Brown, five other Aztecs finished the afternoon with multiple hits. That group included Allen (RBI, two runs scored), France (RBI, two runs scored), Zier (RBI, run scored), Adkison (RBI) and Pallares (RBI, run scored).</p>
<p>San Diego State and Nevada will conclude their series on Sunday (Mar. 9) with a contest scheduled to start at noon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aztecs Defeat No. 24 University of San Diego 8-5</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO, Calif. &#8211; San Diego State put six runs on the board in the bottom of the third inning and went on to defeat 24th-ranked University of San Diego, 8-5, Tuesday evening at Tony Gwynn Stadium. The win improved SDSU to 9-3 as it continued its best start to a season since the 1997 campaign. USD, meanwhile, saw its record fall to 8-3.</p>
<p>The Aztecs got on the board quickly with a run in the opening frame as Greg Allen led off with a single, stole second and scored on an RBI single by Tim Zier.</p>
<p>Two innings later SDSU used five hits, a hit batter, walk and a passed ball to score six times and take a 7-0 lead. Ty France and Andrew Brown both contributed two-run singles to the rally while Tyler Adkison drove in a run with a bases-loaded walk.</p>
<p>The hits for France and Brown were the first of three for each player during the contest. For Brown, the hits were the first of the freshman&#8217;s collegiate career and included a solo home run. He also registered three RBI and scored once. France tallied three singles on the night along with two RBI and a run scored.</p>
<p>San Diego State starter Brett Seeburger made it through the first three innings unscathed although the Toreros put two runners on in both the second and third. The fourth inning, however, saw him surrender two runs (one earned) on two hits without recording an out before he was lifted in favor of senior TJ Kendzora.</p>
<p>Kendzora proceeded to get the next three outs to end the rally and he would go on to toss 4.2 innings of relief and claim the victory to improve to 1-0. Along the way he allowed three runs (one earned) on three this with two walks and three strikeouts.</p>
<p>After seeing their seven-run lead reduce to two at 7-5 in the top of the eighth, San Diego State added a run of its own in the bottom of that inning on Brown&#8217;s leadoff solo home run to left.</p>
<p>Closer Michael Cederoth, who had come on to record the final out in the top of the eighth, tossed a perfect ninth that included a pair of strikeouts as he recorded his fourth save since moving to the bullpen two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Up next for San Diego State is a return to Mountain West action as it hosts Nevada for a three-game series this weekend that begins with a contest on Friday, March 7, at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<div>The traveling road show that annually comprises the Perfect Game tournament schedule has added a stop in October 2014 that promises to open new doors and present even more opportunities for high school-aged prospects in the state of California.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>The inaugural Perfect Game California World Series will be held Friday through Sunday, Oct. 3-5, on at least eight university and college stadiums and fields sprinkled around Southern California.</p>
<p>The event will be divided into two divisions – Upperclass for prospects in the class of 2015 and younger, and Underclass for those in the class of 2016 and younger – and the 16 teams that will compete in each of the tournaments will be selected by Perfect Game officials and extended invitations to participate. All 32 teams will have their operations based in California.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for this to happen for awhile,” said Mitch Spiers from the Carlsbad-based Team California Warriors. “Perfect Game is great, and for it to come into Southern California like this, it’s just going to open up better baseball around the rest of the state.”</p>
<p>The Team California Warriors join 10 other top-tier programs that have already been extended and accepted invitations to field teams in both divisions. They include: GBG Marucci (from Los Angeles); San Diego Show (San Diego); CBA Marucci (San Bernardino); NorCal Baseball (Pleasanton); Trombly Baseball, (Placentia); Southern California Bombers (La Puente); Playa Vista Orioles (Playa Vista); BPA DeMarini Elite (San Juan Capistrano); SGV Arsenal (West Covina), and CCB Elite (San Jose).</p>
<p>The SoCal Renegades (San Dimas) have accepted an invitation to field a team in the Upperclass division only.</p>
<p>Most of the Cali-based travel ball organizations already invited to the California World Series have sent teams to the Perfect Game/EvoShield Upperclass and Underclass National Championship tournaments in the Phoenix area the last three years and several have won PG national championships in the Arizona desert.</p>
<p>“We’re definitely looking forward to it. Perfect Game events are always really well run and there is always great competition,” Michael Garciaparra from GBG Marucci said. “Unfortunately, we’ve always had to travel to Arizona just to find the fields to play on so this is exciting. Sometimes you can’t always get your best players out there just due to travel restrictions and stuff like that.</p>
<p>“I think this field is going to be pretty strong overall because you’re going to be able to have people drive to these games and maybe spend the night in their own beds as opposed to having coordinate travel and hotels and all that other stuff.”</p>
<p>Jon Paino from CBA Marucci spoke of a different kind of “mileage” the prospects involved with the inaugural PGCWS will pile up, and he wasn’t talking about the miles put on vans, buses and cars while traveling over U.S. Interstate 10 to Phoenix.</p>
<p>“This is something we’ve been waiting for awhile now,” Paino said. “With the mileage that the players get during the event and then even beyond the event with the Perfect Game evaluations and the blogging and all the write-ups and everything that are associated with it, we’re all pretty excited.”</p>
<p>NorCal Baseball and CCB Elite are true Northern California organizations, so they will be leaving their neighborhoods to compete in the PGCWS. But it beats the heck out of going clear across the country to compete in an elite Perfect Game event, according to NorCal’s Rob Bruno.</p>
<p>“NorCal Baseball has participated in a couple of the Jupiter (PG WWBA World Championship) events, but the challenge we have is that it’s quite a task to get so many kids over to the East Coast and they miss three or four days of school,” he said. “This is going to allow us to have the top organizations here in California where we think that year in and year out, California baseball is really the best in the country. … This will allow us to stay on the West Coast, not miss as much school and play unbelievable baseball with unbelievable teams.”</p>
<p>Another drawing card of the event is the venues at which the games will be played. While the sites have not been officially announced, most will be at NCAA Division I universities.</p>
<p>“Not only does it help the colleges that we’re using, it also gets the kids kind of fired up – ‘Hey, I can play here someday; this is where I want to play someday,’” Garciaparra said. “Not only are you going to be playing at a (first-rate facility), it’s kind of inspiring and it gives them something to shoot for.”</p>
<p>CBA Marucci’s Paino added: “In Southern California, facilities are kind of at a premium. With Perfect Game coming in and reserving some those nicer collegiate fields, I know the kids are going to be excited about playing at college venues and just to have a top-notch event like this in California is great.”</p>
<p>Tim Olivarez from the Playa Vista Orioles said that while he has several players from his organization get drafted the majority of the prospects that come through the Orioles’ program end up playing at the collegiate level, often at a powerhouse programs in Southern California.</p>
<p>It is on those programs’ fields that the PG California World Series will be played.</p>
<p>“These are real nice college fields, good fields,” Olivarez said. “I think this (inaugural) PG California World Series should be a good one. It’s going to draw quite a few college recruiters … and the word will get out and they’ll be out taking a look at these ballplayers. It should be well attended on the college recruiting end.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to add to the exposure for all the kids,” Spiers said. “It’s an opportunity for the colleges to take a look at all the talent, and these are the matchups the college recruiters want to see.”</p>
<p>The high level of competition the PG California World Series is sure to offer is another aspect of the event that is attractive to the participants.</p>
<p>“I find it to be exciting because we have a lot of kids that play baseball here in California, period, and having a club tournament for 16 teams from some strong organizations that have been invited, the field won’t be watered down,” the Play Vista Orioles’ Olivarez said. “… We’re excited about playing some real good competition.”</p>
<p>Scott Reed from the Southern California Bombers looks at the invitation to the PGCWS as another tool at his disposal to sell his organization to the area’s rich trove of prospects. Having the event right in the prospect’s backyard is the biggest selling point.</p>
<p>“With this being local and with as many times as we go to Arizona already, it makes it that much sweeter,” he said. “It’s a huge event and it’s something that as a program we can announce to our parents and players at those two age levels and let them know that we’ve got a big-time event and it’s right here in our backyard. And with the college fields that are going to be used, it’s going to be top-notch. It will be something that we will obviously talk about until the time comes.</p>
<p>“Even though it’s still eight months away it will be something that we’ll start gearing up for; it’s the first one and with the teams that are in it, it will be just as good as any other (tournament) across the country, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Perfect Game founder and president Jerry Ford acknowledged the PG California World Series marks the beginning of a “larger commitment” toward high school baseball in both Northern and Southern California.</p>
<p>Tory Hernandez, a former head of baseball operations for the Los Angeles Angels, has been brought on board to increase PG’s reach in California, and full-time administrative staff members and scouting personnel including Brad Clement, Matthew Bliven and Todd Gold will continue to focus their efforts on the West Coast.</p>
<p>“To say that we are taking California seriously would be an understatement,” Ford said. “This very high-level tournament is long past due, with California being the top baseball state in the country. It will be one of several PG events added to the schedule for 2014 and beyond.</p>
<p>“We are going to work with the top teams, find the best players and tell the entire nation who they are,” he continued. &#8220;It’s nothing different than what we always have done, we just want to do it even bigger and better.”</p>
<p>There are spring high school seasons to be played and summer and early fall Perfect Game national championships to be claimed before 32 elite upper and underclass teams take the field in Southern California in early October. But, already, there is a buzz in the air.</p>
<p>“There’s really nothing like it yet in California,” Paino said. “We get so spread out with some of the events in Arizona and some teams prioritizing with other events, so there’s never really a ‘best of the best’ event in California. This has kind of been a longtime coming.”</p>

<p>Looking to get the series at UCLA back on track, the Mustangs looked to the 6-foot, 200-pounder, to get the job done. He definitely didn’t disappoint, sitting 84-87 with his fastball, but doing a terrific job of commanding three pitches for strikes. Lee, on the way to a dominant 8-0 win over the Bruins, threw 108 pitches, 73 for strikes. He struck out seven, walked just one Bruins hitter, and allowed just two hits in a complete game performance. The Bruins and Mustangs are tied 1-1 in the crucial series between the two ranked teams.</p>

<p>Russell Harmening earned his fourth win of the season on Saturday as Westmont Baseball (7-8, 4-8 GSAC) took the first game of a Golden State Athletic Conference doubleheader, defeating #9 Concordia (12-5, 5-4) by a score of 6-4. The Eagles claimed the second game 4-3 in extra innings. Harmening allowed three runs on three hits over seven innings or work. He struck out seven batters and walked two.</p>
<p>Brandon Gildea earned the save after entering the ninth with bases loaded and no outs. Gildea coaxed the Eagles’ Dillon Bryant to hit into a double play without a run scoring. Then, Gildea retired Hodges on a ground out to first to preserve the win.</p>
<p>The Warriors posted their first run in the first inning when David Gabel drove in Gildea on a single through the left side. Gabel drove in Westmont’s second run in the third inning, driving in Joey Gonzales from third base with a sacrifice fly to center field.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES, Calif. – Freshman right-hander <a href="http://www.calpolymustangs.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/bios/lee_slater_sppl">Slater Lee</a> shut out defending national champion and No. 12 UCLA with a two-hitter and <a href="http://www.calpolymustangs.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/bios/torres_nick_eaqk">Nick Torres</a> and <a href="http://www.calpolymustangs.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/bios/mundell_brian_1pxv">Brian Mundell</a> belted three-run home runs as No. 22 Cal Poly beat the Bruins 8-0 in a non-conference baseball game Saturday afternoon in Jackie Robinson Stadium.</p>
<p>Lee (pictured at right)  threw 108 pitches, 73 for strikes, recorded 24 first-pitch strikes to the 31 batters he faced and notched seven strikeouts while allowing just one walk and two harmless singles en route to his second win as a Mustang.</p>
<p>A week earlier, Lee held Kansas State to one run and two hits in 6 1/3 innings with one walk and seven strikeouts in his debut as a Mustang. Cal Poly went on to win the game 5-2.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a very impressive outing by Slater, especially after what UCLA hitters did to us the night before,&#8221; said 12th-year Mustang head coach Larry Lee, noting the Bruins&#8217; 11-hit attack in a 5-2 victory. &#8220;He kept them off balance and his performance is something we will always remember and needed. Slater brought a lot of energy to our ballclub with his performance today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Torres came up with two outs, runners at second and third, and hit the first pitch from Grant Watson for a three-run home run to left field, giving Cal Poly a 3-0 lead in the third inning.</p>
<p>Two innings later, Mundell was at the plate with runners at first and second with nobody out and greeted reliever Scott Burke with a towering, no-doubt home run, also to left field, as Cal Poly broke the game open with a 7-0 advantage.</p>
<p>Both Torres (pictured below) and Mundell have two home runs on the year. Torres has 14 career homers as a Mustang and Mundell 13.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two guys in the middle of our lineup are our best hitters and they came through today,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;Both have the ability to drive the ball and both had very good approaches today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first three-run home run really got our confidence going and the second one was the exclamation mark,&#8221; Lee added. &#8220;Now we need to get the other hitters in our lineup to have better approaches at the plate.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the win, Cal Poly (5-1) evened its series against UCLA (4-2) at a game apiece. Final game and the rubber match is set for 1 p.m. Sunday with sophomore right-hander <a href="http://www.calpolymustangs.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/bios/bloomquist_casey_ysn8">Casey Bloomquist</a> (1-0, 1.80 ERA) on the mound for the Mustangs, facing UCLA sophomore right-hander Cody Poteet (0-0, 2.08 ERA).</p>
<p>The loss went to UCLA junior southpaw Grant Watson (1-1), who allowed six runs (five earned) and six hits in four-plus innings. A week earlier against Portland, Watson, a nine-game winner a year ago, gave up just one unearned run and three hits in seven innings with one walk and eight strikeouts.</p>
<p>Slater pitched Cal Poly&#8217;s first complete-game shutout since Kyle Anderson blanked Washington on March 10, 2012. Only other nine-inning complete-game two-hitter by a Mustang in Cal Poly&#8217;s 20-year Division I history was posted by Mike Zirelli against Fresno State on March 8, 1996.</p>
<p>Lee allowed two runners to third base and retired 12 of 13 Bruin hitters early in the game as well as the final 10 UCLA batters of the contest.</p>
<p>Cal Poly&#8217;s eight hits included a single and home run by Mundell. Senior third baseman<a href="http://www.calpolymustangs.com/sports/bsb/2013-14/bios/allen_jimmy_bahb">Jimmy Allen</a> added a double.</p>
<p>UCLA&#8217;s two singles were by center fielder Brian Carroll leading off the first inning and shortstop Trent Chatterton in the fifth inning.</p>
